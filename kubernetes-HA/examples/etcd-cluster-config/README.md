# etcd Cluster Configuration for High Availability

## Overview

This directory contains example configurations and best practices for setting up a highly available etcd cluster for Kubernetes.

## Configuration Examples

Example configurations will be added soon.

## Best Practices

- Always use an odd number of etcd members (3, 5, 7)
- Deploy etcd members across different availability zones
- Use dedicated machines for etcd in large production clusters
- Ensure backups are taken regularly
- Monitor etcd health and performance
