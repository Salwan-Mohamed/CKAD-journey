## Core HA Concepts

### Redundancy

Redundancy is the foundation of high availability in any distributed system. For Kubernetes, this means:

- Multiple copies of critical control plane components
- Replicated data storage (etcd)
- Multiple worker nodes for application workloads
- Redundant network paths

### Leader Election

Control plane components like the scheduler and controller manager use leader election to ensure that only one instance is active at a time. This prevents conflicts while providing redundancy:

```yaml
leaderElection:
  leaderElect: true
  resourceName: component-name
  resourceNamespace: kube-system
  leaseDuration: 15s
  renewDeadline: 10s
  retryPeriod: 2s
```

### Idempotency

Operations should be designed to be idempotent - meaning they can be safely repeated without changing the result beyond the initial application. This is especially important in environments where network failures may cause retries.

### Self-healing

Kubernetes has built-in self-healing capabilities:

- ReplicaSets ensure desired pod count is maintained
- Node controllers detect node failures
- Kubelet restarts failed containers
- Liveness and readiness probes detect application health

## Control Plane HA

### Recommended Topology

A highly available Kubernetes control plane typically consists of:

- 3 or more control plane nodes
- Load balancer in front of API servers
- Replicated etcd (either stacked or external)

![Stacked etcd Topology](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Salwan-Mohamed/CKAD-journey/main/kubernetes-HA/diagrams/stacked-etcd-topology.svg)

*Stacked topology: etcd members and control plane components run on the same nodes*

![External etcd Topology](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Salwan-Mohamed/CKAD-journey/main/kubernetes-HA/diagrams/external-etcd-topology.svg)

*External topology: etcd runs on dedicated hosts*

### API Server Configuration

The API server should be configured for high availability with:

- Multiple instances behind a load balancer
- Appropriate resource limits
- Connection pooling

### Scheduler and Controller Manager

These components use leader election to ensure only one instance is active:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - kube-scheduler
    - --leader-elect=true
```

See the [High Availability Scheduler Configuration](./examples/ha-scheduler-config/README.md) for detailed information.

## etcd Configuration

etcd is a critical component that stores all cluster state. For high availability:

- Deploy at least 3 etcd instances (preferably 3 or 5, always an odd number)
- Ensure they run on separate physical/virtual machines
- Use low-latency network connections between instances
- Regularly backup the etcd data

For detailed configuration, see [etcd Cluster Configuration](./examples/etcd-cluster-config/README.md).

## Storage Considerations

### Persistent Volumes

For highly available storage:

- Use cloud provider storage with multi-zone redundancy
- Consider using distributed storage solutions like Rook/Ceph
- Create StorageClasses with appropriate reclaim policies
- Implement regular backup solutions for critical data

### Data Protection Strategies

- StatefulSets for stateful applications
- PersistentVolumeClaims with appropriate access modes
- Backup solutions like Velero for cluster-wide data protection

## Network Redundancy

### Load Balancer Configuration

Configure load balancers for control plane and application services:

- Health checks for backend nodes
- Session affinity where needed
- Appropriate timeouts and connection limits

### Service Mesh Considerations

Service meshes like Istio or Linkerd can provide:

- Advanced routing capabilities
- Circuit breaking for failing services
- Better visibility into network health

## Application HA Strategies

### Pod Disruption Budgets

Use PodDisruptionBudgets to ensure minimum availability during voluntary disruptions:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: app-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2  # or maxUnavailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

### Anti-affinity Rules

Spread pods across nodes and zones:

```yaml
affinity:
  podAntiAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: app
          operator: In
          values:
          - my-app
      topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```

### Topology Spread Constraints

Ensure balanced distribution:

```yaml
topologySpreadConstraints:
- maxSkew: 1
  topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
  whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

Comprehensive monitoring is critical for HA:

- Control plane component health
- etcd metrics
- Node and pod resource utilization
- Network health

Recommended stack:
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Alertmanager for alerts

Essential alerts:
- etcd member availability
- Control plane component health
- Node availability
- Certificate expiration

## Performance Testing at Scale

### Kubemark

Kubemark is a tool used to simulate large Kubernetes clusters for testing control plane performance without requiring the full resource footprint.

See the [Kubemark Setup Guide](./examples/kubemark-setup/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### Performance Metrics

Key metrics to track for large clusters:

- API server latency (target: 99th percentile under 1 second)
- Pod startup time (target: 99th percentile under 5 seconds)
- etcd operation latency
- Controller reconciliation times

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

Regular backups should include:

- etcd data
- Persistent volumes
- Kubernetes resources

Tools like Velero can help with comprehensive backups.

### Recovery Procedures

Document and regularly test recovery procedures:

1. etcd restoration
2. Control plane rebuilding
3. Data restoration
4. Service validation

## Common Failure Scenarios

Prepare for these common failure modes:

### Control Plane Node Failure

- Impact: API operations may be temporarily unavailable
- Mitigation: Multiple control plane nodes, leader election
- Recovery: Automatic with proper configuration

### etcd Member Failure

- Impact: Cluster state operations impacted if quorum lost
- Mitigation: At least 3 etcd members, proper monitoring
- Recovery: Replace failed member, restore from backup if needed

### Network Partition

- Impact: Nodes may become unreachable, potential split-brain
- Mitigation: Multi-zone deployment, robust health checks
- Recovery: Automatic reconciliation once connectivity restored

### Worker Node Failure

- Impact: Pods on that node become unavailable
- Mitigation: Pod anti-affinity, multiple replicas
- Recovery: Automatic rescheduling of pods
