## About CKAD

The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) program is designed to certify that users can design, build, configure, and expose cloud-native applications for Kubernetes. A CKAD can define application resources and use core primitives to build, monitor, and troubleshoot scalable applications and tools in Kubernetes.

The exam is an online, proctored, performance-based test that requires solving multiple tasks from a command line.

## Learning Path

This repository follows a structured learning path:

1. **Understanding core concepts**: Start with fundamental Kubernetes components
2. **Hands-on practice**: Apply knowledge with practical exercises
3. **Exam preparation**: Focus on speed and efficiency for the test
